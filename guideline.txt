1) Create Three Agents:

    General Query Agent → Handles generic chatbot interactions.

    Admissions Agent → Specializes in answering Concordia CS program queries.

    AI Agent → Provides AI-related insights.

2) Define a Routing System:

    Implement an intent classifier (simple keyword matching or a small LLM model) to direct user queries to the appropriate agent.

3) Integrate External Knowledge Sources:

    Use Wikipedia API for fact-checking.

    Optionally, pull data from official Concordia websites for admissions queries.
